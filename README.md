# light-fp
A basic Typescript functional programming (fp) library.

// TODO: mention server, split modules up
This library provides data types typed general as well as a few helper functions for Arrays, Objects, control flow, function composition.

I created this library for myself as a learning exercise and also as a more basic, and hopefully more accessible alternative to some other typescript fp libraries.

Inspiration from the excellent book *functional programming in scala* Manning, Cats scala library and the javascript library Ramda.
