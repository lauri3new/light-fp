# light-fp
A basic Typescript functional programming (fp) library.

This library provides typed general helper functions for Arrays, Objects, control flow, function composition, Option and Either data types amongst other things.

I created this library for myself as a learning exercise and also as a more basic, and hopefully more accessible alternative to some other typescript fp libraries.

Inspiration from the excellent book *functional programming in scala* Manning, and the javascript fp library Ramda.
